# Student-Grading-System
 This project is a student grading system. - It supports 2 user type(students and lecturers).
 The lecturer can assign different grading percentages for assignments, projects, and exams for each course.
 Students can select the courses they want to register for.
 The lecturer should see all students registered for a course and assign total marks for assignments, projects, and exams.
 The app uses the grading percentages entered to calculate the total marks out of 100.
 It should then calculate a letter grade for each student: 80 - 100 = A, 70 - 79 = B, etc.
 Students should see their grades for each course on their dashboard.
